                I am a Liverpool-based photographer specialising in gig and music photography. My passion lies in capturing the buzzing energy of live shows, providing artists and audiences with images that truly reflect the vibrant atmosphere. Aspiring to be part of the local music scene led me to discover my love for photography, and I have since immersed myself in it. I enjoy meeting new artists and exploring Liverpool's dynamic music culture. If you're looking for a photographer, I’m available for work—<a href="contact.html" class="contact-link">get in touch!</a>
